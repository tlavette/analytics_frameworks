In todayâ€™s data-driven world, frameworks like CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases), and SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) provide structured approaches for building reliable data science and analytics solutions. Each framework has unique strengths tailored to specific stages in the data mining lifecycle, making them essential tools for solving complex problems in industries ranging from finance to healthcare. This article explores these frameworks, their components, and how they guide real-world data projects.
